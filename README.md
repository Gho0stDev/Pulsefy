# Pulsefy
Pulsefy is a module to work together with Spotify

Pulsefy is a module for Polybar where it captures the volume of Spotify and shows it how many % it is currently at
it's simple but functional.

`Image showing that the spotify volume icon only appears when spotify is playing music.`

For now, I don't know how I'm going to change its volume without having to enter spotify or change it through pulseaudio (lowering the system volume...). but I'm working on it.

```
[module/pulsefy]
type = custom/script
exec = $PATH/to/script/pulsefy.sh
exec-if = "pgrep -x spotify > /dev/null"
format-padding = 1
interval = 1
format-prefix-foreground = ${colors.green}
format-prefix = "ï†¼ "
format = <label>
label-padding = 0
label = %output%
```
